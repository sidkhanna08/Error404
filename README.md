# Virtual Mouse
This project aims to develop a virtual mouse using deep learning techniques. The virtual mouse can be controlled using hand gestures, which are captured by a webcam and processed by a deep neural network to determine the cursor's movement.
## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the script 'virtualmouse.py' to start the virtual mouse.

# Hand Gesture Volume Control
This project aims to control the volume of audio playback using hand gestures, using deep learning and AI techniques. The system uses a webcam to capture hand gestures and a neural network to recognize and interpret the gestures, then controls the volume accordingly.
## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the script 'vol.py' to start the control the volume using your hand gestures.

# Hand Gesture Zooming 
This project aims to develop a hand gesture-based zooming system using deep learning techniques. The system can be used to control the zoom level of the video, allowing for easy and intuitive navigation.
## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the script 'zoom.py' to start the zooming features using your hand.

# Virtual Keyboard
This project aims to control a virtual keyboard using hand gestures, using deep learning techniques. The system uses a webcam to capture hand gestures and a neural network to recognize and interpret the gestures, then inputs the corresponding characters into a text field.
## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the script 'keyboard.py' to open up the virtual keyboard on your screen and start typing.

# Voice Assistant
This project is a voice assistant that uses AI and deep learning to understand and respond to voice commands.
## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the script 'speech.py' to start the virtual voice assistant
